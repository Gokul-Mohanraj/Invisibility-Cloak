# Invisibility-Cloak
This is a code that renders the person cloaking it invisible. It was written in Python using Open CV concepts. In order to run the code. First take a video of your still background for about 20 seconds. Ensure the following
1. The background is stationary and there is no interference.
2. The cloak being used to cover yourself should be of the same color preferably (can be of ddifferent colors but the mask boundaries need to be adjusted accordingly).
3. The cloak should not have any color common with that of the background or with whatever you are wearing.
4. Please change the boundaries of the masks to suit your cloak's color (Default is Red)

##Requirements
These are the minimum requirements to run this code.
1. Python 2.7 or above
2. Basic Python libraries (NumPy, OpenCV, MatplotLib)

In case these above requirements are not met, the code can also be copied and run on Google Colaboratory/ Jupyter Notebooks.
